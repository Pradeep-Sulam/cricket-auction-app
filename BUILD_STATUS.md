# Build Status & Quick Fixes

## Current Issue: ajv Module Error ✅ FIXED

**Status:** Fixed by adding `ajv` package to dependencies

### What Was Changed:
1. Added `ajv: ^8.12.0` to `package.json`
2. Updated Dockerfile to install ajv during build

### Next Step:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

## Build Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Pull Base Images ✅
- px Alpine nginx image pulled

### Step 2: Build Backend
- Installing system dependencies
- Installing Python packages
- Should complete successfully

### Step 3: Build Frontend
- Installing Node dependencies ✅
- Building React app (currently working on this)
- Creating production build
- Setting up Nginx

## If Build Still Fails

### Option 1: Try Different Node Version
Update frontend/Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
```

### Option 2: Update react-scripts
Update frontend/package.json:
```json
"react-scripts": "5.0.1" → "5.0.3"
```

### Option 3: Use Development Mode
Temporarily skip build step:
```dockerfile
# Skip build, serve from source
RUN npm start
```

## Expected Success Output

When successful, you should see:
```
✅ cricket-auction-backend started
✅ cricket-auction-frontend started
✅ Both containers running
✅ Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Current Status: Rebuilding...

Run:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
